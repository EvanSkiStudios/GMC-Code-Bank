These are a collection of scripts that (relatively) quickly return how far an object can move in a specified direction without knocking into an object. Though it doesn't cover the case where a really fast object pretty much teleports through objects, it does cover all other cases that are likely to occur in a 2D game.

There's actually a very important reason why I'm using instances rather than data structures like structs. This reason is simple: GMS2 uses a data structure called an [R-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) to speed up collision checks. Instances are automatically put into the R-Tree, so I can tap into an R-Tree implementation using collision_rectangle_list without having to actually implement one. I believe the speedup associated with using the R-Tree justifies any slowdown caused by having lots of instances. Of course, if this does become a bottleneck, I'd likely have to make my own R-Tree implementation â€“ and thank goodness that structs will be a thing for everyone by then!

EDIT: I was doing some [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), and I've thought up some ways to fix some of the limitations of the code.
