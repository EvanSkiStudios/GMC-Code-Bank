Here's a Windows Batch script that is *technically* utterly useless, but since that's not the point of this topic, I'm forced to reveal that I find it useful to convince myself that my life is going somewhere:

countLines.bat (Counts lines of gml in a project folder and offers you comfort)
You place it in the project directory of a game (where the .yyp file is located) and run it from a command prompt.
