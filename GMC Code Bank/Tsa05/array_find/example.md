```
array_find(array, value)
```

Finds the index of value in array, or returns -1, because srsly, how is this not a built-in thing?
Also, note the hilarity of the length of this script, while reading the GMS 2.2 continuity thread. See how this script tediously tests its way through amusingly weird problems with equivalency.
