This is probably not a very fancy or advanced function, but it might help some people.

I've looked around for a function that would simply add or change tiles on a tile layer like the old gamemaker used to do ( tile_add ), but couldn't find any. So I made one...

```gml
add_tile(tileset_layer, tileset_index, xx, yy)
```

You must have a tile layer defined with a tileset for this to work.
